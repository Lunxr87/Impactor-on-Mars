# Impactor-on-Mars

This code allows you to see what happens when an impactor, like an asteroid, of some mass hits a planet--in this case Mars.
Six ejecta will spew out towards space at varying velocities, most of which will end up crashing back into Mars.
One of the the ejecta achieves escape velocity, meaning it never comes back.
A plot of the velocities will be produced, giving insight as to how gravity influences these small ejecta.
